# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project is a part of my internship at codeSoft, where I worked on predictive modeling using the Titanic dataset. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The dataset provides various features for each passenger, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc., which are utilized to train the predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset). It contains information about individual passengers on the Titanic, including their attributes and whether they survived or not. The dataset is commonly used for beginner projects due to its availability and relevance.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
- **Approach**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to train a model based on the provided dataset.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtained the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and survival rate.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted or created new features that might improve the model's predictive performance.
5. **Model Building**: Utilized various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc., to build and train the predictive model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the parameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance.
8. **Final Model Selection**: Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieved satisfactory performance in predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. Detailed evaluation metrics and results are documented in the project's code and reports.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The predictive model built as part of this project can be further refined and deployed for practical use cases.
